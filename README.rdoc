== Princess Bride Observer Design Pattern Example

To run this example clone the repo

`$ git clone https://github.com/alexiamcdonald/PrincessBride.git`

Run Bundle

`$ bundle`

Run a Rails console

`$ rails c`

Then create a new movie

`$ m = Movie.new`

Add a plot to the movie

`$ m.plot`

Now try and save this plot to see the plot twist

`$ m.save`

You should see the `vengeance_observer` being called.

Congrats you can now go squash some bugs.

Have fun!
